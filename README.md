Emojify is a program to replace your currently typed text in discord with it's most succinct representation entirely using emojis.
This usually consists mainly of regional indicators but emoji such as :b: :a: :ab: :sos: :up: etc. are used whenever possible.
The default script assumes you have alt+e bound to run this script and lifts those keys to prevent activating any other key binds if you intend to use some other binding change the first two lines of ./emojify to reflect that.

Requirements 

- xclip
- xdotool
- ghc
